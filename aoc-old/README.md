# advent-of-code

In case I forget where I left off with this, I was trying to figure out how modules work.

I created a virtual environment (python -m venv venv) and activated it (./venv/Scripts/activate).

I installed aoc in an editable state (pip install -e .) from the root directory. This seems to be enough to get imports to work without messing with sys.path.
