# README

`aoc-old` is currently everything I've done prior to 2022. 

`aoc` contains some of my 2022 code if I've written it on a device where I've cloned this repo.

I make no assertions about the quality or accuracy of any code contained in this repo -- I usually just try to solve these as fast as I can.
