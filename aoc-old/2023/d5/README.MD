## part one

pretty straightforward

## part two

it seemed pretty obvious that it wouldn't be possible to actually
check all the values in all the ranges, so the idea of just checking the
boundaries of the range intervals seemed to make sense.

having the patience to do it correctly was the real problem. :)
