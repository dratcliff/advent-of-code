# notes

## part one

## part two

If I wanted to solve part two faster, I would have needed to read and understand this a little better:

> Doing this for the remaining example data above results in previous values of -3 for the first history and 0 for the second history. Adding all three new values together produces 2.

For whatever reason, I didn't read the last sentence and it took me a while to notice that I wasn't calculating the final extrapolated value correctly.
