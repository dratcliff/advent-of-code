# notes

## part one

custom sort function using a Counter + map of card values

## part two

modified sort function + modified map of card values

got the wrong answer twice :(
    
took a while to debug because I had too much confidence in my visualization skills.
once I just mapped out the possibilities in comments, i.e., (2,2,1) vs (3,1,1)
it was pretty easy to see what I did wrong.

if I can remember to make these sorts of notes to myself in the future,
I'd surely save myself some mistakes. :)
