# README

`aoc-old` is currently everything I've done prior to 2021. I moved it because I started (but never finished) a very half-hearted effort to figure out how to make an honest python library for some of my utility functions. I've currently given up on that in favor of just importing my utility script directly in the same directory that I write each day's code in.

`aoc` contains my 2021 code. I plan to leave the code however it ends up when I submit a correct answer. I'm trying to get the correct answer as fast as possible. So whenever it's possible to modify part one (losing the original part one code in the process) to re-use for part two, I will probably do that.
